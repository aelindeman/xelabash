# xelabash

A few simple, no-nonsense, non-distracting additions to the standard bash prompt.

## Features

- Compact, minimalist, single-line prompt, featuring:
  - Red `$` (or `#`, if root) in prompt following an error
  - `user@hostname`, but only when in a remote session
  - Git branch and working copy dirty status, when in a Git repo
  - Active Kubernetes context and namespace
- "Better"-than-default autocomplete settings
- Not overly opinionated; designed to integrate with other settings and tools if desired

## Install and Setup

Works best with bash 4.4+. There are no dependencies to install.

To install, simply clone this repo and source `xela.bash` in your `.bash_profile`. (If `.bash_profile` doesn't work, try `.bashrc`.)

```bash
cd
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/aelindeman/xelabash "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/xelabash"
echo 'source "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/xelabash/xela.bash"' >> .bash_profile
```

Xelabash will load configuration files from the `config.d/` folder in this repository, so you can fork this repo and add your own aliases, configs, functions, environment variables, or whatever else you need.

Git and Kubernetes prompt pieces are **opt-in.** Just set `GIT_PROMPT=true` and/or `KUBE_PROMPT=true` before you load Xelabash:

```bash
GIT_PROMPT=true
KUBE_PROMPT=true
source ~/.local/share/xelabash/xela.bash
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to always see them, use a tool like [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) to set those environment variables conditionally based on your working directory.
